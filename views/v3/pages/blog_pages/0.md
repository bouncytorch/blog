...to my blog, where I talk about movies and shows I'm passionate about, music I enjoy listening to and my programming/music endeavours.

# Who am I? {#about}
I'm Jean Valje- Err, I'm a VGM[^1] electronica, orchestral and piano composer, sound designer and piano arranger. I am also a middle node.js developer. Actually this site is **self-hosted** - written, designed and deployed entirely by me with the help of some npm packages, all of which will be listed in the source soon.

## Music {#music}
Currently my portfolio is available [here](https://soundcloud.com/bouncytorch/sets/bouncytorch-portfolio-reel). It includes soundtracks for games like [Spring Escape](https://soundcloud.com/bouncytorch/sets/spring-escape) and [Tails Of A Cat](https://soundcloud.com/bouncytorch/sets/tails-of-a-cat-original-game-soundtrack).

Feel free to check out my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/bouncytorch) for the entire backlog, including sketches and unused tracks, [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41ryjxYFqikzeC3wzKfSkS) for my official releases and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@bouncytorch) for my music videos. 

# What is this site? {#info}
Primarily this page serves as a link tree for my portfolio and my social media. There are multiple reasons as to why I haven't used some kind of third-party resource like [linktr.ee](https://linktr.ee), one of them being because I take pride in my abilities as a web developer and a decent web designer. Plus self-hosting allows for *quite a bit* of flexibility and creative freedom, which I take full advantage of. That's why I have this blog!

I also want to use this site both as a portfolio item and a testing ground for web development jobs.

# What's the blog for? {#blog}
The reason I created this blog is I always wanted to share my opinions on and experiences with various subjects, above all else I want to share my thoughts on shows and films I found interesting, cuz I'm a big film enthusiast. I will also share my music production experiences, programming tutorials and miscellaneous stuff. 

For example, couple months ago I've gone through the entirety of a very niche show I found called *Jojo's Bizarre Adventure*. It's an *interesting show* to say the least, and I've had a plethora of thoughts and opinions on it I really hope to assemble in a form of review soon.
